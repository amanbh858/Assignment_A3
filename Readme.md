Kindly login to http://st125713.ml.brain.cs.ait.ac.th to view the web application and model in action.

I used the Flask framework for front end web application and for visualization and changed the target variable to 0 1 2 3 to cheap affordable expensive etc.

The CI/CD pipeline involve:

Run the test which involves checking the model being registered to the mlflow

Run the test which involves checking the model saved locally input and its param

Run the test which involves checking the model output

Login in to Docker and Build the docker image

SSH to the ml2023 server using private key and proxy jump

Went to the  st125713 directory and then pull the image and make it run
